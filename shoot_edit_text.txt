How to Shoot and Edit a Local Business Commercial
Core Goal
Youâ€™re not making a pretty montage.Youâ€™re making a 60-second ad that:
Hooks the viewer in the first 3â€“5 seconds.
Clearly shows what the service/experience feels like.
Ends with a specific call to action that can actually generate sales.
Everything below exists to serve those three things.
Pre-Production (Weeks Before the Shoot)
Talk to the client
Before you touch a camera:
Clarify:
What are we selling? (exact service/offer)
Who is it for?
What should viewers do after watching? (click, book, call, visit)
Ask where the ad will live:
Website (horizontal 16:9)
Social media (vertical 9:16)
Paid ads (both)
Write a simple script
Aim for ~60 seconds. Structure:
Hook (first line):
Directly hit a problem or desire.
Example: â€œIf youâ€™re feeling tense, stressed, and overwhelmed, itâ€™s time to reset.â€
Experience / solution:
Walk the viewer through the experience step by step.
Focus on sensory detail and transformation:
What they see, hear, feel.
Offer + call to action:
Spell out the offer (time, price, discount, location).
Tell them exactly what to do:
â€œClick below to book,â€
â€œCall now,â€
â€œBook your first session today.â€
Turn the script into a shot list
For each beat of the script, define:
What we see while that line is heard:
Wide: establish space and vibe.
Medium: show the process.
Close-up: show details and emotion.
Extreme close-up: hands, feet, tools, textures.
Aim for:
A mix of wides, mediums, tights, and extreme close-ups.
Enough coverage that youâ€™re never stuck on one shot for too long.
On-Set Workflow (Order of Operations)
On shoot day, the basic order is:
Shoot the hook.
Shoot the outro / call to action.
Record the entire script as audio (like a voiceover) while talent is still micâ€™d.
Shoot B-roll to cover the whole script.
Finish with extra detail shots to give yourself options in the edit.
Youâ€™re building the spine first (hook + CTA + full script), then filling it with visuals.
General Shooting Practices (Camera-Agnostic)
Frame rate and motion
Use 24 fps (or 25 if youâ€™re in a PAL region) for the main edit:
Hook
Most talking moments
Outros / CTA
Use a slightly higher frame rate (e.g., 30 fps or 50/60 fps) for B-roll when:
You want a subtle slow-motion feel.
Youâ€™re capturing gentle, slow movement (hands, water, fabrics, etc.).
Rule of thumb:
Main narrative: 24/25 fps.
Soft slow-mo B-roll: slightly higher frame rate, slowed down in post.
Shutter and exposure (generic)
Shutter:
Use roughly double the frame rate (180Â° shutter equivalent).
Example:
24 fps â†’ ~1/50
30 fps â†’ ~1/60
Exposure:
Use your cameraâ€™s exposure tools:
Histogram, zebras, false color (if available).
Skin tones should sit comfortably above mid-grey without clipping.
Avoid â€œmonster lightingâ€:
Donâ€™t light from directly below the chin.
Look for a soft shadow under the chin and one side of the face slightly darker.
Lighting basics
Key light:
Place the key light so the subject faces slightly toward it and toward camera.
Soften it (softbox, bounce, diffusion) to match the mood of the business (spa = soft, relaxing).
Back/hair light:
Add a small light behind or above to separate talent from the background.
Ambient mood:
Lift exposure enough so itâ€™s readable.
Do not flatten or over-brighten a space that is supposed to feel cozy or calm.
Audio
Use lav mics for spoken lines if possible.
Monitor levels:
Avoid clipping.
Capture at a healthy level with headroom.
Bonus: if you have timecode or any sync tool, use it; if not:
Clap for sync.
Keep good notes on which audio track goes with which talent.
Backup recording
If your camera supports dual recording (two cards), use it.
If not:
Keep extra cards.
Donâ€™t fill any card to 100%.
Back up as soon as youâ€™re done.
Directing and Capturing Performance
The hook
Direct the hook like a mini-scene:
Give your subject a simple action:
Coming out of a relaxed state in a chair.
Walking into frame.
Have them deliver one strong line aimed at:
The viewerâ€™s problem.
The name of the service.
The feeling theyâ€™ll get.
Get multiple takes:
Slightly different wording.
Different energy levels (more calm, more direct, more â€œurgent but warmâ€).
The outro / call to action
While theyâ€™re still comfortable and micâ€™d:
Record the CTA:
â€œClick below to book your first experience.â€
â€œBook now to get your first session at [price].â€
Get multiple versions:
Short, punchy version.
Slightly longer version that includes the offer.
You might not end up using a talking-head outro, but having it gives you options.
Recording the full script as audio (voiceover model)
Before you remove mics:
Have them read the entire script like a voiceover.
They donâ€™t need to be on camera. This audio will be covered by B-roll.
Direct them to:
Read naturally.
Pause between sentences.
If they mess up, restart from that sentence only.
Result: You now have a clean, complete narration track that describes the full experience and offer.
B-Roll Strategy (Visualizing the Script)
Start with movement shots
If youâ€™re using a gimbal, slider, or any stabilizer:
Use it while itâ€™s already set up.
Get your wider and medium moving shots first:
Establish the space.
Show the environment, dÃ©cor, and overall vibe.
Track the customer entering, sitting, relaxing.
Cover the whole experience
Match B-roll to the script beats:
Arrival / context
Exterior of the business.
Door, sign, logo.
Client walking in.
Settle in
Chair reclining.
Weighted blanket, warm towels.
Close-ups of hands placing the blanket, adjusting the chair.
Sensory elements
Essential oils, candles.
Steam or warm towels.
Close-ups of textures (fabrics, tools, bottles).
Service in action
Hands working on feet, hands, neck, shoulders, head.
Different angles:
Over-the-shoulder.
Side profile.
Tight detail shots.
Afterglow / exit
Client relaxed, smiling softly.
Standing up, stretching.
Walking out of the room or building.
Variety of shots
For each moment, aim for:
Wide shot â€“ show the space and context.
Medium shot â€“ show the interaction.
Close-up â€“ show emotion and details.
Extreme close-up â€“ tools, skin, water, oils, contact.
Get more than you think you need:
You want options to maintain pacing at 2â€“3 seconds per shot.
Handheld detail shots
If youâ€™re going handheld:
Make the camera slightly heavier with a handle, cage, or monitor:
More mass = smoother motion.
Use three points of contact:
Camera/rig against your chest or shoulder.
Right hand on grip.
Left hand under lens/rig.
Direct your talent:
Move slower than feels natural.
Hold positions for longer.
Repeat the same action if needed so you can get multiple angles.
Editing the Commercial
Build the structure
Drop your voiceover/full script audio into the timeline.
Place your best hook take at the very beginning.
Lay B-roll over the script so the visuals:
Follow the experience chronologically.
Show the steps as theyâ€™re being described.
Pacing
Aim for 2â€“3 seconds per shot on average.
Shorten shots to:
Keep energy up.
Avoid repetitive visuals.
If the ad feels slow:
Cut earlier.
Use tighter shots.
Drop redundant angles.
Choosing the ending
You have two main options:
Talking-head CTA on screen:
Talent speaks directly to camera.
Text or logo appears beside/over them.
Experience ending:
Show the client leaving relaxed.
Cut to logo and text with a CTA (no talking head).
Choose whichever feels more confident and on-brand for the business.
Delivering Both Horizontal and Vertical Versions
Shoot with both formats in mind
When framing on set:
Keep main action centered or slightly toward the middle vertically.
Avoid putting key information at the extreme edges:
It may get cropped out in vertical.
If your camera allows higher resolution or taller aspect capture (e.g., full sensor rather than strict 16:9):
Use that to give yourself extra room to reframe in post.
Edit workflow
Primary edit in horizontal (16:9):
Build your main cut for web and YouTube.
Lock pacing and story here first.
Duplicate for vertical (9:16):
Copy the full timeline.
Paste into a 9:16 sequence.
Reframe each shot:
Slide the frame up or down to keep faces and action centered vertically.
Avoid cropping off hands, faces, or key elements.
Captions and on-screen text
Especially for vertical (where people often watch muted):
Add captions for key spoken lines.
Use a clear, bold font when possible.
If the brandâ€™s font is thin:
Add a soft black gradient bar behind the text at the bottom to improve legibility.
Keep text:
Short
High contrast
Easy to read instantly
Color and Finishing (Camera-Neutral Log Workflow)
If you shot in a log profile:
Technical conversion
Apply an appropriate log-to-Rec.709 transform or LUT.
This gets you into a normal contrast and color space.
Basic correction
Adjust exposure until skin tones look natural.
Fix color temperature (too warm / too cool).
Adjust tint (remove green/magenta shifts).
Creative look
Optionally add a gentle creative LUT or grade:
Slight warmth for a spa.
A bit more contrast, but not harsh.
Dial back intensity so it supports, not dominates.
Optional bloom / softness
Add a subtle glow/bloom on highlights if you want a more â€œfilmic,â€ gentle feel.
Do not overdo it; the image still needs clarity.
Final check:
Does it still feel like a cozy, calm, relaxing space?
Can you clearly see the essential actions and expressions?
Business Outcome: Making the Ad Work
The end goal:
Viewers:
Understand the service.
Feel what it would be like to experience it.
Know exactly what to do next.
The client cares about:
Clicks
Bookings
Revenue
So make sure the ad:
Clearly states the offer.
Clearly states the action (â€œClick below,â€ â€œBook now,â€ etc.).
Feels trustworthy and aligned with the brand.
