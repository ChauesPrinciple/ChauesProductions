            <p>Photography is the art of fixing an image in durable form through either a chemical or digital process.
                It requires a detailed, scientific knowledge of how light reflects off the lived environment and how
                that light reacts to various light-sensitive media. It also requires a sophisticated grasp of color
                temperature and the interplay of light and shadow. An artists sensibility to composition, the
                arrangement of objects, and setting within the cameras frame to achieve balance and visual interest.
                Not to mention a deep, technical understanding of the gear required, cameras, formats, lenses, and their
                respective idiosyncrasies. And it helps if you know how to tell a story in a single image, frozen in
                time. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>

            <p>Now, do that at least 24 times every second.</p>

            <p>Thats <em>cinema</em>tography: Capturing the moving image.</p>

            <p>For many film lovers and even just the casual viewer, this is what we show up for. But I've waited five
                chapters to discuss it because it's important to understand that cinematography — while it may often
                get
                the most glory — is only one part of how cinema works. Without a sophisticated mise-en-scène and a
                narrative to follow, it's just a bunch of meaningless images. Not to mention the importance of
                editing,
                sound, and performance. Put it all together, cinematography is the anchor point to a much larger
                cinematic experience.</p>

            <p>The person responsible for all of this is the <strong>cinematographer</strong>, sometimes known as the
                <strong>director of photography (DP)</strong>. Their job is to translate the directors vision into
                usable footage, using all of the photographic skills listed above and only after making a series of
                crucial decisions, which we will get to below. It is one of the most technical jobs in cinema, requiring
                as much science as it does art:

            <p>And just as the production designer oversees a whole crew of craftspeople helping to fully realize the
                mise-en-scène, the cinematographer also relies on a large team known as the <strong>camera
                    department</strong><em>. </em>The camera department includes the <strong>camera operator</strong>,
                the person actually handling the camera. I know; it seems like that should be the cinematographer. And
                it often is. However, on larger productions with multiple cameras or very complex shots, the
                cinematographer can only be in one place at a time. Theres also the <strong>1st assistant camera (1st
                    AC)</strong>, which is responsible for the camera components, swapping out lenses, and, most
                importantly, keeping the camera in focus. However, that last job is sometimes given to another dedicated
                member of the team, the <strong>focus puller</strong>. Then you have the <strong>2nd assistant camera
                    (2nd AC),</strong> who assists the 1st AC and often operates the <strong>slate</strong> or
                <strong>clapper </strong>(more on that later).
            </p>

            <p>A relatively new member of the camera department is the <strong>Digital Imaging Technician
                    (DIT)</strong>. With the rise of digital cinematography, instead of a dedicated person responsible
                for loading film onto the camera (known as a <strong>film loader</strong>, so creative with the names),
                we now have a person solely responsible for organizing the digital files coming off the camera. That can
                include quality control and <strong>color correction</strong> during the shoot.</p>

            <p>Outside the dedicated camera department, the cinematographer also oversees the <strong>lighting
                    department</strong> as well as the <strong>grip department</strong>, also known collectively as
                <strong>grip and electric</strong>. The lighting department is, well, responsible for all the lights
                required to shoot a scene. As should be obvious, lights require electricity. Electricity can be
                dangerous, especially when 100 crew members are running around trying to get a shot before lunch. So,
                the head of the lighting department is a skilled electrician known as the <strong>gaffer</strong>. The
                gaffer has a first assistant as well, called the <strong>best boy</strong>. (I know, not very
                gender-neutral. If the "best boy" is female, they might be called <strong>best babe</strong>, which
                is
                worse.) And then a whole crew of <strong>electrics</strong> is responsible for putting the lights
                wherever the gaffer tells them to. <strong>Grips</strong> are there to move everything else that
                <em>isn't</em> a light. That includes lighting stands, flags, bounces, even cranes, dollies, and the
                camera itself. The head of the grip department is the <strong>key grip</strong>, and one of their most
                important jobs is on-set safety. With so many literal moving parts, it is very easy for someone to get
                hurt.
            </p>

            <p>Thats a lot of people to keep track of for one cinematographer, but fortunately, there is a tightly
                controlled hierarchy, and they all know their jobs. A simple command from the cinematographer, "Flag
                off
                that 10k, were going wide on the dolly," may sound like gibberish, but everyone on a film set knows
                exactly what to do. In fact, theres a whole cinema-specific vocabulary that film crews use to keep
                the
                shoot moving quickly and efficiently. From <strong>apple boxes </strong>to <strong>barn doors</strong>
                to <strong>C-stands</strong>, the lingo can get downright bizarre. Clothespins are not clothespins;
                theyre <strong>C-47s </strong>(and yes, <u><a href="http://www.scoutingny.com/its-called-a-c-47-dummy/"
                        target="_blank">they use a lot of
                        clothespins on a film set</a></u>), and breakfast isn't the
                morning meal; its the first meal on set, which could be 6 oclock in the evening. And if someone is
                in
                the bathroom, theyre <strong>10-100 </strong>(or <strong>10-200</strong> as the case may be), but
                theyre definitely <em>not </em><strong>"in the can"</strong>, which is what you say when a scene
                is
                completed.</p>

            <p>But aside from the esoteric lingo on the set, there are a few key terms everyone should know. The first
                is the <strong>shot</strong>, the most basic building block of cinematography. As mentioned in Chapter
                Two, a shot is one continuous capture of a span of action by a motion picture camera. A finished film is
                made up of a series of these shots of varying lengths, that ultimately tell the story. But during
                production, each shot may need to be repeated several (or dozens or even hundreds of) times until
                everyone gets it right. Every time they repeat the shot, its called a <strong>take</strong>. And once
                the director and cinematographer feel they have the best version of that shot, its time to move the
                camera — and everything associated with it — to a new shot, sometimes just a slightly different
                angle on
                the same scene. Thats called a <strong>set-up</strong>. New set-ups require everyone on the crew to
                jump into action, rearranging the camera, the lights, the set dressing, etc. That can take time. Lots of
                time. And its one reason assistant directors, responsible for planning how long it will all take,
                think
                of the schedule in terms of the number of set-ups a crew can accomplish each day.</p>

            <p>Obviously, a film set is a complicated place requiring a complex choreography of dozens, if not hundreds,
                of personnel all dedicated to rendering the moving picture. But there are many decisions a
                cinematographer has to make before they even arrive on set. These decisions — film or digital, black
                and
                white or color, lighting, lenses, framing, and movement — are all made in collaboration with the
                director and in service to the narrative and the overall mise-en-scène. Some of them are incredibly
                technical, and some are purely aesthetic, but each one of them will affect how we engage in the
                cinematic experience.</p>

            <p>One of the first decisions a cinematographer must make is what medium she intends to use to record the
                images: a physical film stock or a digital sensor. While this is a highly technical decision, it is also
                an important aesthetic choice that will affect the overall look of the final image. Not only are there
                differences in the look of film versus digital recording generally, but there are also subtle
                distinctions in the various film stocks and manufacturers, as well as the different types of digital
                sensors that come with different camera systems. Lets take each one in turn.</p>

            <p>Good old-fashioned film stock has been around since the dawn of cinema, though it has evolved quite a bit
                since those early days. In the beginning, the strips of light-sensitive material were made from nitrate,
                a highly flammable material, which was not so great when it was whirring through a projector past a hot
                lamp. It's one of the reasons many early films are lost to history. They simply burned up too easily.
                Today, film stock is made from a much sturdier plastic. And on that plastic is a gelatin coating
                containing thousands of microscopic grains of light-sensitive crystals called <strong>silver
                    halide</strong>. When light hits those crystals, they darken, depending on the amount of light. (And
                if it's a color film, there will be three separate layers of those crystals, one blue, one red, and
                one
                green.) A chemical bath enhances that reaction to light, rendering a negative image that can then be
                projected.</p>

            <p>Once a cinematographer commits to this analog, chemical process, there are still a lot of decisions to
                make. First, they must choose a <strong>film gauge</strong>, that is, the size of the film stock. The
                film gauge is determined by measuring from corner to corner the individual frames that will be exposed
                to light. The standard film gauge in cinema today is 35mm, but sizes range from as small as 8mm all the
                way up to 70mm. And each size will render a different look, with more or less detail once enlarged. They
                must also decide how sensitive the film will be to light. Highly sensitive, or "fast" film stock,
                that
                is, a film that reacts quickly to relatively low levels of light, contains relatively large silver
                halide crystals (more surface area to absorb the light). The benefit is the ability to film at night or
                in other low-light situations. The drawback is a loss in <strong>resolution</strong> or detail in the
                image due to an increase in the crystals. Or <strong>grain</strong>. Less sensitive, or "slower"
                film
                stock produces a crisper image (due to the smaller crystals) but requires more light.</p>

            <p>There are many other decisions to be made that may affect the final image — the manufacturer, black and
                white versus color, the developing process — but using the physical medium of film stock renders an
                image that many filmmakers claim has a more organic look, a difference you can almost feel more than
                see. And that comes at a price. Film stock must be purchased by the foot, forcing filmmakers to plan
                every shot carefully to avoid wasting material. (Of course, many filmmakers see this as a <em>good
                </em>thing). Not to mention the fact that you don't <em>really</em> know what you have until you
                develop
                the film after a day of shooting. Or the fact that you have to assemble your final film by actually
                cutting and taping together physical strips of film. Or the fact that even if you choose to shoot on
                analog film stock, most of your audience is going to watch a digitized version in the multiplex or on
                their television, laptop or smartphone anyway.</p>

            <p>For these and many other reasons, the good old-fashioned film has fallen somewhat out of fashion in favor
                of the flexibility of <strong>digital cinematography</strong>. Digital cinematography is identical in
                every way to analog film cinematography — same basic equipment, same need to control exposure, shape
                light, compose the image, etc. — with one important difference: the light passing through the lens
                hits
                a digital image sensor instead of a strip of plastic film. That sensor uses software to analyze and
                convert the light bouncing off its surface into a series of still images (just like film stock) that are
                recorded onto flash memory or an external hard drive.</p>

            <p>The advantages should be obvious. First and foremost, there are almost no limits on how much you can
                record, especially as digital data storage becomes cheaper and cheaper. And since the sensor is
                controlled by software, you can adjust settings such as light sensitivity at the press of a button
                rather than changing out the film stock.</p>

            <p>But there are still lots of decisions to be made. Just as there are various film gauges, digital sensors
                come in all shapes and sizes, and every camera manufacturer produces their own subtle variations. And
                while most of us could probably never tell the difference, cinematographers are very particular about
                the way a Canon sensor renders color differently from a Sony sensor or a RED sensor from an Arri sensor.
            </p>

            <p>And then theres the issue of resolution. The standard for "high definition" is an image measuring
                1,920
                pixels by 1,080 pixels, also known as <strong>1080p</strong> (the "p" stands for progressive scan
                since
                the image is rendered line by line from top to bottom). Pixels are the smallest visible unit in a
                screens ability to produce an image. Think of them as analogous to those tiny silver halide crystals
                in
                film stock. 1,920 by 1,080 pixels is a lot of detail, but most digital cinema today is recorded at a
                much higher resolution of at least 4,096 pixels by 2,160 pixels, or <strong>4K</strong>. And even that
                has become commonplace and somewhat outdated. In fact, you probably have a 4K camera in your pocket
                right now. It's on your phone. As the technology improves, well see 6K, 8K, and 10K become
                standard.
                All that information packed into every image renders an incredible amount of detail (and also eats up a
                lot of storage space). Detail most of us, frankly, will not be able to see with the naked eye.</p>

            <p>But resolution isn't the only factor that affects image clarity. Cinematographers can also manipulate
                the
                <strong>frame rate</strong> to render super-sharp imagery. For decades, the standard frame rate for
                cinema has been 24 frames per second. That produces a familiar, cinematic "look" to the finished
                film in
                part because of <strong><u><a href="https://frames-per-second.appspot.com/" target="_blank">motion
                            blur</a></u></strong>, the subtle blurring that occurs between still images passing at 24
                fps. But film shot and projected at 48, 96, or even 120 frames per second renders an ultra-sharp image
                with almost no motion blur as our brains process far more detail between each individual frame. To be
                fair, this is possible with analog film stock, but it is impractical to shoot that much film stock at
                that high a rate. Digital cinematography gives filmmakers like Ang Lee (<em>Billy Lynns Long Halftime
                    Walk</em> (2016), <em>Gemini Man </em>(2019)) and James Cameron (the <em>Avatar</em> series) the
                freedom to experiment with these higher frame rates combined with higher resolution sensors to produce
                images we literally have never seen before.
            </p>

            <p>Another decision cinematographers must make early in the process, in collaboration with the director, is
                whether to record the image in black and white or color. For many of you, this may seem more a question
                of history. Old movies are black and white; modern movies are in color. Once the technology allowed for
                color cinematography, why would anyone look back? But there are a number of reasons why a filmmaker
                might <em>choose</em> to film in black and white over color, even today. They may want to evoke a
                certain period or emulate some of those "old" movies. Or, if the subject matter is relatively bleak,
                they may want the added thematic element of literally draining the color from the image. Or they may
                want to take advantage of the heightened reality and sharp contrast that black-and-white cinematography
                provides. Or maybe they want to foreground the performances. One of the greatest directors in cinema
                history, Orson Welles, once said black and white was the actors friend because every performance is
                better without the distraction of color.</p>

            <p>But I get it. It's not 1920. You don't ride a penny-farthing or listen to music on wax cylinders. Why
                would you watch a movie in black and white?</p>

            <p>Whatever their reason, cinematographers must take several things into account once they choose between
                black and white and color. First, if they are shooting black and white on film, they typically have to
                use a film stock designed for black and white imagery. It is possible to print black and white from a
                color negative, but it wont render the light and shadows in quite the same way as a dedicated film
                stock. And, of course, if they are filming in color, different film stocks from different manufacturers
                will render colors differently depending on the desired effect. If they are using digital technology and
                want the final product to be black and white, the color is usually removed after filming in
                post-production. But they still have to balance lighting and exposure for how the image will render
                without color. In either case, it's important to note that black-and-white cinematography requires
                just
                as much attention to detail in the filming process as color.</p>

            <p>Whether shooting film or digital, black and white or color, one of the most powerful tools a
                cinematographer has to work with is light itself; without light, there is no image, and there can be no
                cinema. But simply having enough light to expose an image is not enough. A great cinematographer —
                heck,
                even a halfway decent one — knows that their job is to shape that light into something uniquely
                cinematic. To do that, they must have a deep understanding of the basic properties of light. Four
                properties, to be specific: <strong>Source</strong>, <strong>Quality</strong>, <strong>Direction,
                </strong>and <strong>Color</strong>.</p>

            <p>The source refers to both the origin and intensity of the light. There are two basic distinctions in
                terms of origin: natural or artificial. <strong>Natural light</strong> refers to light from the sun or
                moon (which is really just the sun bouncing off the moon, but you knew that), and <strong>artificial
                    light</strong> refers to light generated from any number of different technologies, LED,
                incandescent, fluorescent, etc. Each source will have its own particular characteristics, exposing a
                shot in its own particular way. Artificial light allows a cinematographer an incredible amount of
                freedom to manipulate and shape the light. Scenes shot indoors on a soundstage can be made to look like
                daytime exteriors with enough artificial light. Scenes shot outdoors at night can also be augmented with
                artificial lights standing in for moonlight. But natural light can also be manipulated and shaped
                through filters, flags (large black fabric squares used to block off the suns direct light), and
                diffusers.</p>

            <p>Each new scene will require the cinematographer to consider their light source and how they want to shape
                it. And a big part of that calculation is <strong>intensity</strong>. How bright is the source, and how
                is that going to affect exposure? Well discuss <strong>depth of field</strong> later on, but how much
                light a cinematographer has to work with affects how much (or how little) of the shot can be in focus
                and how balanced their exposure will be in the final image. Sometimes a cinematographer can get away
                with just using <strong>available light</strong>, that is, the light from the pre-existing fixtures in a
                location (also called <strong>practical lights</strong>). But more often, they want to control the
                intensity more precisely, so they use specialized lights to illuminate the scene from outside the frame
                of the image. The lamps and overhead lights you might see in a film or TV series are actually more props
                than true lighting sources. They indicate to the viewer where the light is coming from in a given shot
                —
                what cinematographers call <strong>motivating</strong> the light source and direction — but they
                rarely
                add anything to the exposure of the scene.</p>

            <p>The subject in the scene is lit by several bright artificial lights just off camera. The table lamp in
                the background is only there to "motivate" the light that illuminates the side of the subjects
                face.
                But its really just a psychological trick. If you really think about it, a dim lamp behind and to the
                right of the subject should not illuminate his face at all, but our brain tells us, "Sure, that makes
                sense." Thats because we really <em>want</em> to believe; we don't want to think about a crew of
                people
                standing around bright lights while a camera records it all. We want to be fooled, and the
                cinematographer knows that.</p>

            <p>The second property of light cinematographers have to think about is quality. This doesnt mean
                "good" or
                "bad," its more about how the light "feels" in the shot. The easiest way to think about
                quality is in
                terms of <strong>hard</strong> or <strong>soft</strong> lighting. Hard lighting is intense and focused,
                creating harsh, dramatic shadows. Soft lighting is more diffused and even, filling the space with
                smooth, gradual transitions from light to dark. The difference is actually less about the light on the
                subject and more about the shadows cast by the subject. Are the shadows clearly defined with a hard
                edge? Youve got hard lighting. Are the shadows fuzzy, less clearly defined, or maybe even absent
                entirely? Youve got soft lighting. Cinematographers can control the quality of light by adjusting the
                size of the light source and its distance from the subject. Typically, the smaller the light source and
                the closer to the subject, the harder the light:</p>

            </div>

            <p>The third important property of light is direction. Where is the light coming from in the scene? Not the
                source, what <em>makes </em>the light, but what <em>direction</em> is it coming from? Left, right,
                below, above? Each decision will affect the look and feel of a scene, and practical lights in the set
                design can help motivate lighting direction. A single overhead lamp in an interrogation room will
                motivate a hard light from above. Large windows can help motivate a soft, diffused light from one side
                of the room.</p>

            <p>Cinematographers plan their lighting set-up for any given scene by thinking carefully about what
                direction the light is coming from, starting with the main source of illumination, the <strong>key
                    light</strong>. The key light is usually the brightest light on the set, used to properly expose the
                main subject. But just one bright light will feel like a spotlight, creating unwanted shadows. So, they
                use a <strong>fill light</strong>, usually less intense and a bit softer than the key light, to fill out
                those shadows. But those two lights shining on the front of your subject can make the scene feel a bit
                two-dimensional. To bring some depth to the image, they use a <strong>backlight</strong>, usually a hard
                light that shines on the back of a subjects head (also called a <strong>hair light</strong>), to
                create
                some separation between the subject and the background. The brightness of each of these lights relative
                to each other is known as the <strong>lighting ratio</strong> and can be adjusted for various different
                effects. This lighting setup is known as <strong>three-point lighting</strong>, and its the most
                basic
                starting point for lighting a scene:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">

            </div>

            <p>Of course, three-point lighting is just that, a starting point. Really complex lighting schemes will
                require far more layers to the set-up. But even then, cinematographers will talk to their gaffers,
                electrics, and grips in terms of key, fill, and back lights.</p>

            <p>The fourth property of light that every cinematographer must understand is color. And no, I don't mean
                red, blue, and green light bulbs. I mean the subtle color cast that different light sources give off
                that will ultimately affect the exposed image. For example, a typical household incandescent light bulb
                uses a tungsten filament to produce light. That light usually has a warm orange glow to it. But a
                fluorescent tube light in a ceiling fixture gives off a cooler, bluer light. In fact, weve come up
                with
                a way to measure these differences using the concept of <strong>color temperature</strong>. Color
                temperature is measured in degrees Kelvin. The lower the degree Kelvin, the warmer or more "red" the
                light. The higher the degree Kelvin, the cooler, the more "blue" the light. The orange glow of a
                tungsten bulb is around 3200 Kelvin. Daylight is around 5600 Kelvin.</p>

            <p>It can get a little confusing, I know. Check out this quick overview of the science behind color
                temperature and how we use it in cinema:</p>

            </div>

            <p>As should be clear by now, color temperature matters a great deal when a cinematographer wants to set a
                particular mood. For example, a romantic scene in a candle-lit restaurant should have a warm orange
                glow. Fortunately, you don't need to rely on a thousand candles to achieve that effect. Most modern
                LED
                (light-emitting diode) lights can be adjusted according to color temperature. All you have to do is dial
                in 2000K to your key, fill, and backlights, and you get the equivalent of the warm glow of candlelight
                without the fire hazard.</p>

            <p>Source, quality, direction, and color are the four most important properties of light cinematographers
                must master to create great cinema. Once we understand these same properties, we can start to understand
                how cinematographers combine them to achieve an effective lighting <strong>style</strong> in any given
                scene, film, or series. For example, by lowering or removing the key light and relying more on indirect,
                relatively hard fill and backlights, you create deep shadows and high contrast in a scene. As mentioned
                in Chapter Three, this style of lighting is known as <strong>low-key lighting </strong>(because of the
                lack of a dominant key light, not because its laid back), used to evoke mystery and even terror.</p>

                he approaches lighting style in his work:</p>

            <p>Another powerful tool a cinematographer has to work with is, of course, the camera. And there is a lot
                that goes into how that particular apparatus works and the nuances between different formats and
                manufacturers. But I want to focus on the one component that is interchangeable and allows for endless
                variety: the <strong>lens</strong>. No matter what camera a cinematographer chooses, its the lens
                that
                determines the clarity, framing, depth of field, and exposure of the image. Just by changing the lens,
                without moving the camera at all, you can radically transform the look of a shot.</p>

            <p>The principle behind a camera lens is pretty simple. A piece of curved glass (or several pieces depending
                on the lens), held in place on the front of the camera, focuses light through an adjustable aperture (a
                fancy word for "hole") and onto light-sensitive material (film or a digital sensor). The aperture
                controls the amount of light entering the camera, and the glass "elements" control the sharpness of
                the
                image by moving closer or further away in tiny increments from the aperture. The overall distance
                between the sensor and the point at which the light passes through those glass elements is called the
                <strong>focal length</strong> and is measured in millimeters. So, in a 50mm lens, the distance between
                the sensor of the camera and the point where the light passes through the glass of the lens is 50
                millimeters.


            </p>

            <p>The focal length determines both the <strong>angle of view</strong> and the
                <strong>magnification</strong> of the image. The shorter the focal length, the wider the angle of view
                and the smaller the magnification. The longer the focal length, the narrower the angle of view and the
                greater the magnification. Any lens below 35mm is generally considered a "wide-angle lens" because
                of
                its relatively short focal length. Any lens above 70mm is considered a "telephoto lens" because it
                greatly magnifies the image.
            </p>

            <p>Lenses can be divided into two basic types based on how they treat focal length: <strong>zoom
                </strong>and <strong>prime</strong>. Zoom lenses allow you to adjust the focal length by sliding the
                glass elements closer to or further away from the sensor, thus greatly magnifying the image or widening
                the angle of view without swapping out the lens itself. Prime lenses have a fixed focal length. What you
                see is what you get. Now I know what you're thinking. Why not just slap a zoom lens on there and
                choose
                your own focal length? But actually, cinematographers almost always use prime lenses when filming. For
                one thing, zoom lenses tend to have many more glass elements than primes and that can affect the quality
                of the image. But more importantly, prime lenses force the cinematographer to be more deliberate and
                intentional about the angle of view and magnification of a particular shot.</p>

            <p>The angle of view and magnification is important in terms of whats visible in the frame, but just as
                important is what appears to be in sharp focus. Lenses also allow cinematographers to control the depth
                of the image by either isolating a subject as the only element we see clearly in a particular shot or
                allowing us to see everything in the background and foreground equally. This is called <strong>depth of
                    field</strong>, the range of distance in front of the camera in which subjects are in sharp focus.
            </p>

            <p>Take a look at this image:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Note how the figure of the man lighting his cigarette is isolated from the background, focusing our
                attention on the spark from the lighter. This is an example of a <strong>narrow depth of field</strong>.
                The range of distance in front of the camera in which subjects are in sharp focus is relatively small,
                creating less depth in the image.</p>

            <p>Now check out this image:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">
                <div style="position: relative; width: 640px; height: 360px; margin: auto;">

            <p>Note that everything seems to be equally in focus, allowing us to pick out all of the details of the set
                design. This is an example of a <strong>wide depth of field</strong> or <strong>deep focus</strong>.</p>

            <p>But since cinematography is all about <em>moving</em> pictures, this is not necessarily a binary choice.
                A cinematographer can <em>change</em> the depth of field within a shot to shift our attention from one
                subject to another. This is called a <strong>rack focus </strong>or <strong>pull focus:</strong></p>

            <p>Now that you know what it is, youll see it <em>all the time</em> in film and tv. In fact, theres
                usually one person on set whose only job is to manage those shifts in the depth of field within a shot.
                They're called, appropriately enough, a <strong>focus puller</strong>.</p>
            <h2>The Director of Photography</h2>
            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_c67340ddcec24fe186b39f4ff489555c_image_41166713821666192599267.jpg"

                    alt="A person looking through the viewfinder of a large film camera in black and white."></p>

            <p>Probably the second most important person on the set behind the Director is the Cinematographer or “DP,”
                the Director of Photography. This person is tasked with visually helping the Director create the look
                that he or she wants for the film. This person must have strong skills as both an artist and a technical
                expert. Remember to differentiate this person from the Camera Operator, whose job is to shoot the
                footage. One person could do both jobs on a smaller production, but larger productions today typically
                have many camera operators but only one DP. Lighting is a key component of Cinematography. For artistic
                reasons, it is also an important quality of mise-en-scene. Still, it is also a critical component of
                cinematography because of how it is used to create contrast and exposure.</p>

            <p>Cinematography depends on three primary things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The composition of the objects and people within the frame</li>
                <li>The photographic quality of the image</li>
                <li>The movement of the camera</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The very first Cinematographers were all accomplished Still Photographers. Thus it is not surprising to
                find some very well-composed shots in some of the very earliest Lumiere films in 1895:</p>

            <p>One of the first things we teach students of either video or still photography is not to frame the main
                subject in the dead center of the screen; instead, we teach them the “rule of thirds” in terms of where
                to place the main subject, at one of the four points of intersection: (you draw imaginary lines, and
                separate the vertical parts of the picture into thirds, and the horizontal picture into thirds)</p>

            </div>

            <p>(The shot on the left positions the main object in the center of the frame and is not as well composed as
                the same image on the right, which balances the objects better.)</p>

            <p>A well-composed shot positions everything in the frame with a sense of appropriate balance. In the shower
                scene in <i>Psycho, </i>Marion is in the right foreground, taking a shower, while the left background
                contains the door that opens and the murderer coming in with the knife.</p>

            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_dc79ceaf335145239688db462ce25e72_image_35637813081666192599296.jpg"

            <p>The Photographic Aspects of the shot have much to do with the <b>tonal range</b>, the contrast range
                between the lightest and darkest areas within the image. One of the reasons film was preferred over
                video until the recent development of 4K and 6K cameras( like the RED cameras) was the ability of film
                to record a much greater contrast range than video. Still, these recent developments in the digital
                video have eliminated this gap. It used to be that video cameras would lose definition at both ends of
                the tonal range; the darker areas would be a muddy grey, and the lighter areas would burn out and look
                overexposed. The industry has been rapidly shifting to HD Digital Video in recent years. However, some
                directors (like Quentin Tarantino) still prefer to shoot 35MM films, despite the high costs and
                declining stock availability.</p>

            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_c49e35c036a6423192c1711ee6d374d9_image_4717081791666192599308.png"
                    style="display: block; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 100%;" alt="RED Camera"></p>

            <p>(Above is the RED 6K Digital Video Camera, with its accessories. The first 4K version of this camera came
                out in 2007 and cost $20,000, vs. the Panavision 35MM Film Camera, which costs $500,000)</p>

            <p>In the past, Directors and Cinematographers also relied on different kinds of film stocks to achieve
                certain looks in their films – some “slow” stocks gave an incredible richness to the color, while “fast”
                stocks increased the “grainy” look desired for documentaries or other “realistic” films. Today’s
                sophisticated post-production software tools have changed this situation too – you can pretty much
                completely alter what is shot in the field to look like whatever you want to in the digital environment.
            </p>

            <p>DP’s also used to have to use certain color or diffusion “gels” over the lights to create effects on the
                set, but that too is largely unnecessary today; these effects can be created by using digital filters in
                post-production.</p>

            <p>For video, the key term is lines of resolution. When we speak of 6K, we mean 6000 vertical lines of
                pixels in the frame. Most of you have wide-screen televisions with either 720 or 1080 vertical lines of
                resolution. 6K packs more than five times as many lines into the frame. The older, more square format
                televisions and older camcorders typically only had 300-400 lines of resolution, so you can see how much
                this quality has improved in recent years. The ASPECT RATIO (the width vs the height) also changed with
                the newer flat screens, from 4X3 to 16X9, which is much closer to what we have always seen in movie
                theaters. We thus no longer have to cut off the side parts of the images to make a film viewable on
                television.</p>

            <p>CAMERA FILTERS (a ring filter that screws onto the lens, like the one below) can be used to add color or
                soften the image. I was taught to use Vaseline on a clear camera filter to create a dreamy look. We also
                used a blue filter to make an overcast day look like a clear, blue sky day.</p>

            <p><b>SPEED OF MOTION</b> also has an impact on how we perceive a shot. Many of the earliest film cameras
                were hand-cranked to move the film past the shutter. A camera person could intentionally <b>overcrank
                </b>the film when recording it; when it was played back at normal speed, it created the first “slow”
                motion effects. Similarly, they could <b>undercrank</b> the film when recording, creating the comic
                effect of speeding up time, like in the Keystone Cop movies.</p>

            <p>“Slow” motion often is used for fantasy or dream-like sequences, to showcase special powers, or to
                express a lyrical quality (think of the shots of butterflies or birds in flight). These types of effects
                look better if created “in-camera” rather than in post-production because of what we call the
                <b>“rasterized”</b> look in digital, which involves duplicating the frames to create slow motion, which
                does not look as clean as a slow-motion shot created “in-camera.” Newer cameras can shift into recording
                at higher or lower frame rates on the fly (in the middle of recording), and this is what brought what is
                called “bullet time” into defined cinematic terms today because of the famous scenes in <i>The Matrix:

            <p><b>LENSES</b> change the scale and depth of an image, and they can distort images, flatten space, and
                exaggerate depth. The cinematographer has the ability to change lenses, which gives them the power to
                dictate the perspective of the viewer. </p>

            <p>The distance from the center of the lens to the camera sensor is what we call the focal length. For 35MM
                cinematography, a 50MM lens is considered to be “normal”, since it essentially duplicates what our eyes
                can see without either reducing or enlarging the image. Wide Angle Lenses vary between 20MM and 35MM,
                and Telephoto Lenses range from 80MM-300MM.</p>

            <p>Before the time when zoom lenses became available, there was usually a turret of three lenses on the
                front of many cameras, a normal lens, a telephoto lens, and a wide-angle lens. If there was just a
                single lens mount, these 3 lenses were available and interchangeable; the cinematographer would choose
                the one deemed appropriate for the shot. Below is a shot of the vast array of available lenses for the
                Panavision 35MM film camera:</p>

            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_5f3771fa19cf489796a6278afd952142_image_373922330151666192599328.jpg"

            <p><b>ZOOM Lenses</b> (lenses that can change the focal length in the middle of a shot) were a dramatic
                addition to the art of filmmaking. The history of the zoom lens dates back to the telescope's
                development, but the modern zoom lens was developed by Pierre Angenieux in the 1950s and was first used
                in the late 1950s. This zoom lens allowed for precise focusing while physically zooming in or out from a
                shot.</p>

            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_a3574f915b20476a8379a9078aa7ae31_image_109540437161666192599332.jpg"
                    style="display: block; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 100%;" alt="Zoom Lens"></p>

            <p>The image below, left, is an example of wide-angle focus, and the image on the right is an example of a
                close-up with a telephoto lens. Note the clear background and sense of depth the wide-angle lens gives.
                Typical of a close-up with a telephoto lens, the background is blurred out, and the depth is flat.</p>

            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_19b600dde56e48d0950cc6f1f835b9c9_image_811868136171666192599335.jpg"

            <h1>Depth of Field and Focus:</h1>
            <p>Depth of field refers to the distance between the closest objects in the frame and the furthest objects.
                Normally, if the camera person focuses on someone with objects in the foreground and deep in the
                background, the foreground and background objects will be out of focus. One of the revelations of the
                great cinematography by Gregg Toland in <i>Citizen Kane </i>was how he kept all of these objects in
                focus by using a wide-angle lens, good lighting, and very fast film stock.</p>

            <p>In the scene you can link to below, notice how the image of young Charles Kane playing in the snow stays
                in focus even as the camera moves backward:</p>

            <p>Here is a still shot from the above Citizen Kane scene:</p>
            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_951fc12d2b894cc5975362d9fb90b456_image_864937669181666192599342.jpg"

            <p>Keeping a camera in focus used to be done manually in the many years before we had cameras with
                <b>automatic focus</b> – in fact, on some of the more complicated shots, this was the job of the “Focus
                Puller,” whose name you would see in the film credits. Take another look at the famous shot from
                <i>Psycho, </i>which was incredibly ambitious for 1959. The camera was on a dolly; it had to be pushed
                from the bathroom into the bedroom, and the camera person had to pan first to get the newspaper on the
                nightstand and then pan up to show the house on the hill through the window. After practicing, the focus
                puller had to practice and change the setting on the fly.

            <p>Rack Focus is used to direct the audience’s attention by changing the object of focus between a
                background object and a foreground object. Notice how this is used in a scene from Pan’s Labyrinth:</p>

            <h1>Camera Angles and Their Meanings</h1>
            <p><b>High Angle</b> shots imply smallness or submissiveness; if you are shooting from the perspective of a
                tall building down on your subject at street level, you make your subject look smaller and less
                significant.</p>
            <p><b>Low Angle</b> shots imply superiority or dominance; looking up at someone makes them appear to tower
                over you and gives them more power.</p>
            <p>Think of our courts; typically, the Judge is on a platform looking down at all of the participants. A
                King or Queen similarly sits on a throne and looks down at the people, while they look up at him or her.
                Looking up at a tall mountain or imposing building can give the feeling of taking on a big challenge.
            </p>
            <p><b>Eye-level</b> shots often can indicate confidence, comfort, and normalcy.</p>
            <p>The <b>Canted Angle</b> or <b>Dutch Angle</b> shot is when the camera is intentionally held on its side
                to accent some kind of drama, like when a panicked person is running away from someone trying to kill
                them.</p>

            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_4ef47a62455f4388bd9941909d46e878_image_356030357211666192599355.jpg"
                    style="display: block; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 100%;" alt="Dutch Angle Example"></p>

            <p>The comparative height of people in a frame influences how we perceive them; the comedian Jon Stewart is,
                in reality, a short man, but on his talk show, when seated, he always appears to be of an equal height
                to his guests, because he understandably wants to be seen as being on an equal footing with the guest.
            </p>

            <h2>Tripod and Handheld</h2>
            <p>The heavyweight of initial cameras meant they had to be on tripods to achieve a steady image.</p>
            <p>Hand-held shots were first seen in the French New Wave films that took advantage of film cameras like the
                Arriflex and the Éclair that could be hand-held with a shoulder mount to give the camera person more
                freedom.</p>

            <p><img src="https://elearn.nscc.edu/content/enforced/9554851-ENGL-2140-MC-WEBO-7W/File_d021d932128746b5ba987b2e92487542_image_509498174221666192599358.jpg"
                    style="display: block; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 100%;" alt="Arriflex Camera"></p>

            <p><strong>MOB</strong>: ways of moving the camera during the shot</p>
            <p><b>Panning</b>: moving the camera on a tripod from right to left or left to right.</p>
            <p><b>Tilting</b>: moving the camera on a tripod up or down</p>
            <p><b>Tracking</b>: moving the camera on a rolling dolly or on a set of railroad tracks to follow two people
                down the street who are talking to each other. On some of my shoots, we used a “poor man’s dolly” – a
                shopping cart (!) to achieve the same idea, by sticking the cameraperson in the cart and having someone
                else push it.</p>
            <p><b>Crane</b> <b>Shots:</b> have been around since the days of DW Griffith. The last shot in Citizen Kane
                is a great example of a crane shot:</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Steadicams</h2>
            <p>Steadicams dominate shooting today. These are harness devices that let the camera be suspended on a
                floating tripod head that does not pick up the jarring impact of the walking of the cameraperson, thus
                achieving dramatic smoothness in tracking shots. Steadicams are widely used today --- it used to be that
                production could only use one camera because of the expense. Still, today it is common to use multiple
                cameras, making continuity editing automatic (the action is GUARANTEED to match because it was shot
                simultaneously). </p>

            <p>One of my favorite examples of a Steadicam shot is in a 2014 music video from Kiesza; the entire video is
                one take and involves over 10 performers coming in and out of the moving camera shots. Watch this, and
                let it inspire you to think of your favorite steadicam shots from a recent film or music video.</p>

            <h1>Types of Shots</h1>
            <p><b>Long Shot or Establishing Shot</b>: this shows all of the space and people in a particular scene. This
                is “establishes” the location and gives the audience a sense of grounding.</p>
            <p><b>Medium Long Shots:</b> This shot is from the knees up; suitable for conversations between 3 people
                where there may be some action going on in the background</p>
            <p><b>Two-Shots</b>: show the relationship of the characters. These are usually done in parallel and “over
                the shoulder” of each of the characters; combined with close-ups and cutaways, this can give the editor
                enough footage to put together the scene.</p>
            <p><b>Medium Close-Ups, Close-Ups, Extreme Close-Ups</b>: the closer you get, the more emotions can be
                conveyed by the actors. I have always thought that this was a significant advantage that film has over
                traditional theater, where it is very difficult to see the actors and actresses close up. MCUs are from
                the chest up, CUs are just the face, and ECUs are of aspects like the eyes or the mouth.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Special Effects</h1>
            <p>Special effects play a huge role in films today. When we use this term, most of you immediately think of
                CGI and the kinds of virtual effects that can be blended with “normal” location footage to make it seem
                like there are dinosaurs running around free on an island off the coast. But the technology has also
                enabled the producers and directors of many other films to return to being shot mostly in studios. They
                can still create the feel of being on location by seamlessly combining a studio foreground shot with a
                location background. This video link helps explain how studio shots are today being composited with
                location shots:</p>

            <div class="mt-video-widget mt-video-width-55">

            <p>Combining these studio shots with location footage has been one of the key reasons so many film studios
                have been built in Georgia in the past ten years and why this industry has become so crucial to our
                state. Another primary reason is the tax incentives offered by the State of Georgia. Still, the
                advantages of shooting many more scenes in a studio setting are tremendous. You don’t have the cost of
                transporting, housing, and feeding the cast and crew in remote locations. You don’t have to worry about
                the weather or the availability of enough electricity for lighting and other needs. You have total
                control over almost all other variables in the studio, including the ability to record better sound.</p>

            <p>To write about Special Effects in your papers, it’s important that you understand the history of how
                these effects have evolved over the years and the tremendous planning and expense that goes into
                creating them. All of this is so that these scenes have some emotional impact on the audience. Your job
                is ultimately to articulate why these effects worked or didn’t.</p>

            <p>One of the first Special Effects was an accident. One of the cinematographers for the Lumiere Brothers in
                the 1890s accidentally discovered what happened when a piece of film was reproduced in reverse order and
                showed a wall that had been destroyed magically rebuilding itself:</p>

            <p>George Melies discovered how to stop the camera and then put people into a scene as he added a puff of
                smoke to make them magically appear or disappear. He also pioneered the use of multiple exposures of a
                piece of film to create other comical/magical effects</p>

            <p>In <i>Metropolis</i>, Director Fritz Lang and his team of technical experts used models, mirrors, and
                miniature insets to make the director’s vision of 2027 come to life:</p>

            <p>Most of you have seen <i>The Wizard of Oz, </i>the first film to ever feature any color scenes that came
                out in 1939. Some of the more challenging effects they had to create are explained in this short video.

            <p>In Alfred Hitchcock’s 1939 film <i>Foreign Correspondent, </i>war breaks out between England and France
                on one side and Germany on the other side as a plane with the main characters is flying back to the
                United States. A German Navy vessel fires on the plane, and it crashes into the ocean. To create this
                scene, the film was used from a stunt plane flying over the water. This footage was then projected on a
                sheet of rice paper in front of the plane on a studio set. Thousands of gallons of water then crash
                through the rice paper and into the plane to simulate the crash at sea.</p>

            <h2>Stop Motion Animation</h2>
            <p>Stop motion animation was another technique that was developed to add special effects, particularly to
                fantasy films that involved creatures like King Kong and Godzilla. The undisputed master of these
                techniques was Ray Harryhausen; here is a wonderful compilation of the best of his work. These scenes
                look ridiculous today, but they provided thrills to audiences who had not seen films with the advanced
                special effects that all of you are used to seeing today.</p>

            <p>In many films before 1960 (like Hitchcock’s films), REAR PROJECTION was used to combine a studio shot
                with an on-location background. The background scene would be shot and then projected onto a screen
                behind the actors on the set – many “driving” scenes were done this way, with actors sitting in a
                stationary car. In contrast, the background made it seem like the car was moving or unseen stagehands
                might physically jostle the car to create the bumps.</p>

            <p>After Rear Projection shots started to seem more fake, some producers started using PROCESS TRAILERS to
                make these shots look more realistic. This is a platform for the car that is towed behind a truck.</p>
