# Tokyo in Film: Production Camera Manual

This document serves as the field guide for our production kit, detailing how to use our specific cameras for narrative and commercial work.

# Camera 1: Insta360 X5 (A-Cam / Capture Device)

**Concept:** A "Capture Device" rather than a traditional camera. Commit to blocking on set, decide framing in post.

## 1. Core Philosophy
*   **The Superpower:** Reframing 360 spheres into virtual wides, mediums, and inserts.
*   **A-Cam Role:** Shots unsafe for cinema cameras, complex action coverage, invisible rig shots.
*   **Limitation:** Use traditional cameras for close-ups and texture.

## 2. "First Day" Setup
*   **Lens Protection:** Critical. Check for smears before every take.
*   **Audio:** Enable wind reduction appropriate for location. Use Mic Adapter for narrative.
*   **Default Modes:**
    *   **Narrative/Coverage:** 360 Video @ **8K 30fps**.
    *   **Action/Daylight:** Active HDR @ **5.7K 60fps**.
    *   **Low Light:** PureVideo.

## 3. Settings & Exposure
*   **Resolution:** 8K 30fps is main. 5.7K 60fps for slow-mo/action.
*   **AdaptiveTone:** Use for mixed lighting (cars, doorways).
*   **Motion Blur (ND Filters):**
    *   **With ND (ND16/32):** Photographic, cinematic motion. Crucial for "film look".
    *   **Without ND:** Sharp, "Action Cam" look.

## 4. Shot Recipes
### A. Car Shots
1.  **Invisible Chase Cam:** Rear mount, centered. 8K 30fps. Reframe as "3rd Person" video game view.
2.  **Cabin Dialogue Master:** Center console mount. Single take provides Wide 2-shot + Singles for both passengers.
3.  **Undercar Energy:** Low mount, road texture focus.

### B. Action/Martial Arts
1.  **One-Take Coverage:** Static placement. Capture the full exchange. Cut as if you had 3 cameras (Wide, Med, Insert) from the one file.
2.  **Orbit on Impact:** Move the camera physically in a safe arc; counter-rotate virtually in post to lock onto impact.
3.  **Overhead Geometry:** Top-down mount. Clarifies grappling/entanglement.

## 5. Transitions
*   **Reframe Whip:** Quick pan in post + motion blur obscures the cut.
*   **Object Wipe:** Use passing objects to mask cuts.
*   **Same Take, New Lens:** Cut from Wide to Tight using the same clip. Perfect continuity.

# Camera 2: Insta360 Ace Pro 2 (B-Cam / Coverage Multiplier)

**Concept:** Rugged, always-ready, wide-angle B-cam. Not for matching A-cam texture, but for "getting the shot."

## 1. Role Definition
*   **Use for:** Dangerous angles (skid, crash), continuity wides, environmental cutaways, low-light utility.
*   **Do Not Use for:** Primary dialogue close-ups (unless style dictates).

## 2. B-Cam Discipline
*   **Shutter:** 180-degree rule (1/48 or 1/60).
*   **WB:** **LOCKED**. Do not use Auto WB.
*   **Color:** Neutral profile. Match contrast/sat to A-cam in post.

## 3. Core Presets
1.  **Intercut Safe:** 4K, Match A-cam fps, Shutter 180, Stabilize High, Horizon On.
2.  **Action Insert:** 4K 60p/120p, Shutter 1/120+, Stabilize High. Chest/Bar mount.
3.  **Reframe Master:** 8K 30p. Shoot wide, crop in post for vertical/punch-ins.
4.  **Low-Light:** PureVideo mode. (Note: Horizon lock limitations).

## 4. Audio Strategy
*   **Hierarchy:** External Mic > A-Cam > Ace Pro 2 (Scratch/Ambience).
*   **Use Cases:** POV commentary, tire/road noise beds.

## 5. Mounting & Composition
*   **Chest:** Best "Human" POV.
*   **Helmet:** Aggressive POV.
*   **Rear Seatpost:** Chase view.
*   **Low Fork:** Speed texture.
*   **Rule:** Compose for the edit. Keep horizons clean unless tilting for energy.

## 6. Sync Workflow
*   **Timecode:** Enable if supported.
*   **Manual:** Clap/slate at every start/battery change.
*   **File Management:** Short, intentional clips. Treat as "High Volume B-Roll".

# Camera 3: Fujifilm X-T2 (C-Cam / Reliable Master)

**Concept:** The camera you leave running. Wide safety, cutaway machine, and reliable quality.

## 1. Role Definition
*   **Primary Jobs:** Wide safety, Environmental Wide, Cutaways (Hands/Reactions), Alternate coverage angle.
*   **Rule:** Prioritizes **continuity and coverage** over experimental looks.

## 2. Hard Limits (Plan Around)
*   **Record Limit:** 10 mins (4K) / 15 mins (HD) on internal battery. Grip extends to 30 mins.
*   **Bitrate:** 100 Mbps (Internal 4K).
*   **Audio:** No headphone jack on body (only on grip).

## 3. Pre-Rig Checklist
*   **Must:** Battery Grip, 3 Batteries, 2 SD Cards, Small Tripod/Monopod.
*   **Rec:** Variable ND (maintain 1/50 shutter), Shotgun mic.

## 4. Operating Modes
*   **Mode A (Fast Match):** Film Sim workflow (PRO Neg. Std). Best for coverage/docs.
*   **Mode B (Match in Post):** HDMI External Record (8-bit 4:2:2). Best for lighting/interviews.

## 5. Standard Settings
*   **Res:** UHD 4K 24p (or match project rate).
*   **Shutter:** 1/50 (for 24p). Fixed.
*   **WB:** Manually set Kelvin or Custom. Never Auto.
*   **Exposure:** Protect highlights (X-T2 clips fast). Use DR200/400 if needed.

## 6. Audio Strategy
*   **Role:** Sync Reference / Scratch.
*   **Process:** Clap/Slate every setup.

## 7. Quick Start Logic
*   **Stability:** Use a tripod/monopod. This is the "Anchor" camera.
*   **Focus:** Manual with Peaking. Stop down (f/4-f/5.6) for deep focus safety.
