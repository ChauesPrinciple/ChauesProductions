        <h1>Visual Foreshadowing</h1>

        <div class="textbook-content">

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This assignment invites you to explore how filmmakers prepare their audience for significant moments
                through <strong>visual foreshadowing</strong>—using production design, cinematography, or editing to
                plant seeds that pay off later in the narrative. Using <em>Shoplifters</em> (2018) as our reference
                example, you will analyze how visual elements create the feeling of inevitability rather than surprise.
            </p>

            <h2>Throughline Example: Shoplifters (2018), Hirokazu Kore-eda</h2>

            <p><strong>The "I Should Have Seen That Coming" Moment</strong></p>
            <p>Great foreshadowing isn't a puzzle you're meant to solve in the moment; it's a feeling you can't shake.
                In <em>Shoplifters</em>, Kore-eda tells us the truth about this family from the very first frame, but
                we're too charmed to notice.</p>

            <p>Look at the house. It's not just messy—it's temporary. Things are piled up, not put away. Suitcases are
                often visible. The sleeping arrangements shift like tetris blocks. Visually, this is a transit station,
                not a home. The production design screams "impermanence" while the characters act out domestic
                stability.</p>

            <p>Then there's the framing. Kore-eda loves to shoot through things. Doorways, racks of clothes, windows. He
                constantly puts barriers between us and the characters, suggesting that there is something hidden,
                something we aren't being shown. It creates a subtle, subconscious tension. We feel like voyeurs spying
                on a secret, which turns out to be exactly what we are.</p>

            <p>When the reveal finally drops—that they are strangers bound by crime, not blood—it doesn't feel like a
                cheap twist. It feels inevitable. We look back and realize the visual language was telling us the truth
                the entire time.</p>

            <h3>Key Visual Cues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Clutter of Transience:</strong> The set design emphasizes portability and lack of
                    ownership, hinting that this arrangement could dissolve in an instant.</li>
                <li><strong>Obstructed Views:</strong> Shooting through layers of foreground objects visually reinforces
                    the theme of hiding and secrets.</li>
                <li><strong>Ritual as Performance:</strong> Watch how they perform family roles (eating together, hair
                    cutting) a little <em>too</em> deliberately, visually signaling that they are playing house rather
                    than living it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Films to Choose From</h2>
            <p>Analyze visual foreshadowing techniques in a scene from one of these films:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Spirited Away</em>, Hayao Miyazaki</li>
                <li><em>Your Name</em>, Makoto Shinkai</li>
                <li><em>Akira</em>, Katsuhiro Ôtomo</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Prompts</h2>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 1: Production Design Foreshadowing</span>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Analyze how objects, environments, or costumes prepare the audience for a
                    future moment.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions to Consider:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What object, costume, or environment carries hidden significance?</li>
                    <li>Where does this element first appear? Where does it reappear?</li>
                    <li>How does this element connect to the narrative payoff?</li>
                    <li>Does the film draw attention to it, or let it exist naturally in the background?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> In <em>Shoplifters</em>, the cramped quarters and improvised sleeping
                    arrangements suggest instability. The audience registers the lack of permanence without consciously
                    noting it—until the reveal makes those details resonate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 2: Cinematography Foreshadowing</span>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Explore how framing, camera movement, or composition plants visual seeds.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Questions to Consider:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What visual strategy (framing through obstacles, use of negative space, recurring shots)
                        prepares the audience?</li>
                    <li>How does the composition guide or hide the viewer's attention?</li>
                    <li>Does the film use repetition of a particular angle or framing choice?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Kore-eda frequently frames characters through clutter, doorways, or
                    obstructions—suggesting concealment. There is always something between us and the truth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box-exercise">
                <span class="box-legend">Prompt 3: Post-Production Foreshadowing</span>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Examine how editing, color grading, or sound design creates patterns
                    across the narrative.</p>
                <p><strong>Questions to Consider:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the film use omission or elliptical cutting to withhold information?</li>
                    <li>Are there audio cues, motifs, or color shifts that recur before the payoff?</li>
                    <li>How does the editing rhythm change as the foreshadowed moment approaches?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Shoplifters</em> uses elliptical cutting—omitting explanations,
                    ending scenes before conversations conclude—to keep the audience sensing that something is hidden.
                </p>
            </div>

                <li><strong>Subtlety and Integration:</strong> How foreshadowing works without drawing attention</li>
                <li><strong>Inevitability:</strong> How visual preparation makes outcomes feel earned</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
