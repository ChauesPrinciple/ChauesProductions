THE PROCESS FOR CREATING A SHORT FILM OR RECREATING A SCENE
A Practical, Fillable Student Guide
SECTION 1. START WITH LIMITATIONS
Identify what you actually have before designing anything.
Location you can film in: Click or tap here to enter text.Time of day available: Click or tap here to enter text.People available to appear on camera: Click or tap here to enter text.
Props and objects physically present:

Reminder: A scene recreation starts with the reality of the space you will stand in.Nothing should be imagined that cannot be filmed.

SECTION 2. CREATE A LOGLINE THAT FITS THOSE LIMITS
A logline condenses the essential action of the moment into a single, clear sentence. It identifies who the character is in this beat, what they are trying to do, and what stands in their way. Like a thematic statement or a clear line of conflict in a screenplay, the logline gives shape to both the explicit action the viewer will see and the implicit meaning suggested by how that action unfolds.
A useful logline for a short moment or recreated scene focuses on what can be filmed: an observable goal, a concrete obstacle, and the tension created when the two meet. It should guide the choices you will make with blocking, framing, and composition. If the moment is too internal or relies on information the camera cannot show, the logline needs to be simplified until the action is readable on screen.
Write your logline below:Click or tap here to enter text.
Before moving on, confirm that the logline:â˜can be staged in the location you identifiedâ˜expresses emotion through action rather than explanationâ˜defines a conflict that can be shown visuallyâ˜fits within a single beat rather than a full arc

SECTION 3. WRITE ONLY WHAT THE CAMERA CAN SHOW
This step converts your logline into the specific actions the camera will capture.These actions become the basis for your storyboard in the next section.If you cannot list them clearly here, you will not be able to draw or shoot the scene.
List the key actions in the order they occur.Each action should be physical, observable, and tied to the conflict in your logline.
Action 1 (the moment begins whenâ€¦):Click or tap here to enter text.
Action 2 (the character responds byâ€¦):Click or tap here to enter text.
Action 3 (the obstacle affects the action byâ€¦):Click or tap here to enter text.
Action 4 (the moment changes whenâ€¦):Click or tap here to enter text.
Action 5 (the beat resolves whenâ€¦):Click or tap here to enter text.
Checklist before moving on:â˜Can the camera film each action exactly as written?â˜Does each action represent a clear change, not a repeated motion?â˜Can you imagine where the camera would be for each moment?â˜Does the sequence contain a beginning, shift, and end?

SECTION 4. STORYBOARD TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BEFORE SHOOTING
You will draw your actual storyboard panels on a separate sheet.Here, you define the visual decisions each panel must communicate.
EXAMPLE: STORYBOARD PANEL REQUIREMENTS (One Scene)
Framing (wide / medium / close):Click or tap here to enter text.
Camera angle (eye-level, low, high, profile, behind, overhead):Click or tap here to enter text.
Blocking (where the character begins, moves, and ends):Click or tap here to enter text.
Camera movement (static, pan, tilt, slight push-in/pull-back):Click or tap here to enter text.
Key visual detail the viewer must notice:Click or tap here to enter text.
When story boarding, remember: use simple drawings. Planning matters more than artistic skill. Storyboards prevent confusion on location and speed up shooting.

SECTION 5. GATHER VISUAL REFERENCES
You are recreating a specific moment from a film in our course.Use stills from that original scene as your primary references so your framing, angle, and lighting choices are grounded in the source.
Collect images (screenshots or photos) that show:
the angle on the character
the direction and quality of light
the overall mood and color
the composition of people and objects in the frame
the framing style (how close the camera is)
If needed, you may also include one or two photos of your real location to see how closely you can match the original.
Angle reference from the original scene added: 
Yes â˜ or No â˜
Lighting reference from the original scene added: 
Yes â˜or No â˜
Mood / color reference from the original scene added: 
Yes â˜or No â˜
Composition reference from the original scene added: 
Yes â˜or No â˜
Framing distance/style reference from the original scene added: 
Yes â˜or No â˜
List or link your references (original scene and any location photos):Click or tap here to enter text.


SECTION 6. SHOOT ACCORDING TO THE PLAN
Use your storyboard and the images from the original scene to guide every decision on location.Your goal is not to copy the moment perfectly, but to match its structure: angle, distance, timing, and emphasis.
Check the following as you shoot each panel of your storyboard:
Angle and height match the reference (or are the closest possible match in your location):Click or tap here to enter text.
Distance from the subject matches the framing in the original scene (wide / medium / close as planned):Click or tap here to enter text.
Blocking in your real space recreates the original spatial relationship (where the character is, where they move, and how much space surrounds them):Click or tap here to enter text.
Camera movement or stillness follows the original shotâ€™s logic (hold, slight pan, slight tilt, push-in, etc.):Click or tap here to enter text.
Lighting direction is approximated (from the same side, above/below, or backlit as in the reference):Click or tap here to enter text.
Foreground and background elements support the composition (replacing what cannot be matched with equivalents):Click or tap here to enter text.
Several takes are recorded with small adjustments (framing, distance, timing) to give options in editing:Click or tap here to enter text.
If your location cannot match something in the original shot, note how you adapted it and why your version still communicates the same visual beat.
