THREE-SHOT VERSION â€” Car Wash
SHOT 1 â€” THE DRIVEWAY / THE TIME-LAPSE / THE MATH
EXT. MODERN HOUSE â€“ DRIVEWAY â€“ DAY
TIME-LAPSE:The FATHER washes and waxes his classic Mercury Cougar by hand.Sponge, rinse, polish, repeat.Long, careful cycles.
In the same driveway, farther back, the SON quickly cleans his modern compact car with spray wax.Short sprays, fast wipes, no rhythm.
REAL TIME RETURNS:
The father finishes the last section of waxing.
The son walks past.
FATHERThey said on the news this morning that a spray wax like the one you use is being recalled.It takes a year off the paint and makes it peel early.
The son shrugs.
SONSo what?
FATHERWhy do you use it then?
The son points at the wax haze on the hood.
SONI can explain.
He places his finger into the wax residue and writes directly into the hood:
8,760 HOURS IN A YEARSLEEP: 8 Ã— 365 = 2,9208,760 â€“ 2,920 = 5,840WORK: 40 Ã— 52 = 2,0805,840 â€“ 2,080 = 3,760
SON andâ€¦Cleaning: 3 Ã— 52 = 156
The equations fill the hood.
SONThis is everything you get.Three thousand, six hundred four free hours.And one hundred fifty-six of them go right here.
The father stares at the numbers scratched through the wax.
CUT TO:
SHOT 2 â€” THE SPRAY WAX
EXT. SAME DRIVEWAY â€“ CONTINUOUS
The son taps the â€œ156 HOURSâ€ line.
SONHow much would you pay for that time?
The father thinks, and shrugs.
FATHERFive thousand dollars. 
SONThatâ€™s less than the cost of a new paint job.And last Sunday I was helping Mom with the puppies while you were out here.
The father takes the spray wax bottle from the sonâ€™s hand.
FATHERYou just spray it on then?
SONNot gonna say anything else.
The father sprays a small patch on the compact carâ€™s hood.Wipes.Looks at his hand.
FATHERIt just rinses off.
SONYep.
They both look at the spray bottle.
CUT TO:
SHOT 3 â€” THE DOOR
EXT. FRONT DOOR â€“ MOMENTS LATER
The father walks toward the house holding the spray wax.
He goes inside.
The door closes.
From inside, off-screen:
VOICE (O.S.)What are you working on?
HOLD.
CUT TO BLACK.
